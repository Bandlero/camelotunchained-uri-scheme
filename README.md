Camelot Unchained URI Scheme for Application &amp; Website Interoperability

The purpose for this project is to establish a shared URI scheme across all applications, websites, add-ins, mods, and all other data consuming or providing sources created for Camelot Unchained to ensure interoperability and data-exchange consistency across all sources.

For those that don't know what a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is, Wikipedia has a good-enough article on the subject: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier
